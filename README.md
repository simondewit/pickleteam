### Scattertext
The html files in */scattertext/html* can be opened in a web browser and contain plots showing the words most frequently occurring with one of the two emojis that are being compared.

In */scattertext/plot.py* change line 12 and 13 to the numbers corresponding with the emojis you want to compare. (See [CodaLab](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17344) for the emojis and their numbers.)

To use *plot.py*, [Scattertext](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext) must be installed.
On linux, run:

`$ pip install scattertext && python -m spacy.en.download`
